# AU2021 Ocean 511 Fluid Dynamics Coursework
Storing code written for Ocean 511 Fluid Dynamics (taken in Autumn 2021)

Mostly in Jupyter Notebooks but some in MATLAB

### Final Project: Mixing by stirring of a stratified fluid
1. Explore the dependence of the turbulent tracer diffusivity on the stratification of the fluid
2. Quantify the mixing efficiency for different stratifications
